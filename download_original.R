# coppock_kaur_2022/download_original.R
# Output: original/ (the deposited replication archive, not redistributed in this repo)
# Depends on: original_manifest.csv
# Description: Fetch the deposited archive from Harvard Dataverse and verify every
#   file. Run this once before running anything in maintained/. Re-running is
#   free: files already present with the right checksum are not downloaded again.
#
#   The manifest carries two checksums per file. md5_served is the MD5 of the
#   bytes Dataverse returns for `?format=original`, which is what this code was
#   written against. md5_published is the checksum Dataverse displays. Here all
#   ten agree, but they do not always: other deposits in this program carry
#   published checksums that verify neither the original nor the derived tabular
#   file, so verification runs against md5_served and any disagreement is
#   reported rather than hidden by a check failing for the wrong reason.
#
#   Every file in this deposit sits under a `replication_archive` directory
#   label, so the manifest paths carry that prefix and the local copy mirrors it.
